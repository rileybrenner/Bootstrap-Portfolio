        <p class = "about_me_content">Much of my free time is spent exploring outside. My passion in life is surfing. I started at an early age in elementary school in the temperate waters of Northeastern United States. Some of my other hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, paddle boarding, diving and fishing. My passions have taken me across the globe traveling to over a dozen different countries over the past few years. I sometimes find myself searching in some of the most desolate corners of the planet in search of the new frontier for waves and exploration. </p>
